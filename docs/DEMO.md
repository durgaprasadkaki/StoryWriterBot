# Demo Evidence

Use this folder to store proof assets for project submission.

## Required/Recommended Assets

- `screenshots/home.png` – Home/workspace UI
- `screenshots/generated-story.png` – Generated story output
- `screenshots/history.png` – Story history persisted from MongoDB
- Video demo link in README (`Demo Evidence` section)

## Suggested Demo Flow (2-3 mins)

1. Start app with `npm run dev`
2. Show `/health` endpoint status (`mongodb: connected`)
3. Generate a story with ASI-1
4. Open history and load/delete an item
5. Mention stack: React + Express + MongoDB + ASI-1

## Notes

- Replace placeholder screenshot filenames with real captures.
- Keep images optimized for quick GitHub loading.
